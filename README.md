## Introduction
***

A highstreet bank has called in a wizard team of data analysts to help them analyse their credit marketing campaign. 
They want to understand which types of customers respond positively to the campaign and what kind of marketing is most successful.
We received the data set of 18000 records from the previous campaign. This included information about account details over a year, 
demographic and customer segments as well as information about what type of campaign each customer received.


## The Data 


## Day 1
***
Create a DataFrame with the Billboard 100.
The [jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/AnjaFechner/Gnod/blob/main/Web_scraping_single_page_part_1.ipynb) contains the code.

## Day 2
***
- Create a new code for web scraping multiple pages and web scraping a single page with songs and the additional inforamtion about the genre of the song.
This [jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/AnjaFechner/Gnod/blob/main/Web_scraping_multiple_pages.ipynb) contains the code for the web scraping of multiple pages.

## Day 3
***
- Create a song list with the help of a Spotify playlist.
This [jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/AnjaFechner/Gnod/blob/main/spotify_lists.ipynb) contains the code..

- After that, we try to create a function to get a input from the uste, to compare the inputr from the user with the conten of the files and to genrate a output.
This [jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/AnjaFechner/Gnod/blob/main/input_output.ipynb) contains the code. We are not finished.
